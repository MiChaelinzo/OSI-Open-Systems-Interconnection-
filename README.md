OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a reference model for how communication should happen between different systems in a network. It is a seven-layer model that describes how data should be transmitted between two systems. Each layer in the OSI model is responsible for a specific part of the communication process, and the layers work together to ensure that data is transmitted reliably from one system to another. The seven layers of the OSI model are:

1. Physical: This layer deals with the physical connection between devices, such as the cables and connectors that are used to connect them.
2. Data Link: This layer is responsible for creating a reliable link between two devices on a local network. It is responsible for error detection and correction, and for providing flow control to prevent data overflow.
3. Network: This layer is responsible for routing data between two systems on a network. It determines the best path for data to travel and ensures that it is delivered reliably.
4. Transport: This layer is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered reliably between two systems. It provides error checking and retransmission of lost data.
5. Session: This layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions between two systems. A session is a logical connection that allows two systems to communicate.
6. Presentation: This layer is responsible for translating data between different formats, such as converting text to binary data and vice versa.
7. Application: This layer is the top layer of the OSI model and is responsible for providing services to the user, such as email and file transfer.
The OSI model is a useful tool for understanding how different systems communicate with each other on a network. It provides a standard way of describing the different layers of communication and the functions that they perform.
